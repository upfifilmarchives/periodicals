## About the Film Periodical Collection

The Film Periodical Collection of the UPFI Film Archive & Library comprises a diverse range of local and international magazines, journals, and newsletters focused on cinema, media, and visual culture. Collected through subscriptions, donations, and academic exchanges, the collection includes both mainstream and scholarly publications that document the evolving discourse on film aesthetics, criticism, industry practices, and cultural movements.

This collection serves as a vital resource for students, researchers, and film enthusiasts, offering insights into historical and contemporary perspectives on cinema. It reflects the plural and dynamic landscape of film culture in the Philippines and across the globe.

Currently, the UPFI Film Archive and Library maintains three distinct periodical collections:

### Teddy Co Film Periodical Collection
This collection contains film periodicals donated from the estate of the late Teddy Co, noted film historian, curator, and archivist. The materials reflect his deep engagement with Southeast Asian and World cinema. The collection was formally donated to the UPFI in December 2024 and offers a unique, personal archive of rare and historical film publications.

### UPFI Film Periodical Collection
This is the Institute’s core periodical collection, composed of scholarly film magazines and academic journals accumulated over the years. It includes titles such as Sight & Sound, Film Comment, and Cinema Scope, among others, serving as a key research tool for cinema studies in the Philippines.

### UPFI News Clippings
An extensive archive of newspaper and magazine clippings, this collection is the result of active documentation of film-related news, articles, and features from the establishment of the UPFI Film Center in 1976 to the present. It provides a chronological view of Philippine cinema’s development as seen through mainstream and alternative press coverage.
